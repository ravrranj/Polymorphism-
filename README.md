# Polymorphism-
Understanding polymorphism in Java 


Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction). It allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

Polymorphism increases flexibility and maintainability in code. It allows methods to be used interchangeably, making the code more scalable and reducing redundancy.

Types of Polymorphism in Java
Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading) : Method overloading occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters (different number, types, or order of parameters). The method to be executed is resolved at compile time.

Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding) : Method overriding happens when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as in the superclass.
